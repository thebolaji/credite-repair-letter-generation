    <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
    <p style=" line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information contained in my credit report that does not comply with federal or state reporting standards. According to the <strong style="color: #d50032;">Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</strong> and <strong style="color: #d50032;">Metro 2 guidelines</strong>, I have the right to ensure that any information reported about me is accurate, complete, and verifiable. Therefore, I am requesting an immediate investigation into the following errors and demand that the inaccurate information be corrected or removed promptly.
    </p>

    <p style=" line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        The current data reflected in my credit report is neither supported by evidence nor properly documented, and as such, it must not be reported. Allegations of derogatory information or delinquency are being challenged as they do not meet the necessary legal or reporting criteria. Any information reported must adhere strictly to the FCRA and Metro 2 regulations to avoid penalties or legal repercussions.
    </p>

    <p style=" line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Furthermore, I am requesting verification of permissible purpose for every inquiry listed on my credit report. The law requires that proof of permissible purpose be provided for each inquiry, and any inquiry that cannot be properly verified must be removed immediately.
    </p>

    <p style=" line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        In accordance with the law, you are required to complete your investigation and provide evidence supporting the accuracy of your report within <strong style="color: #d50032;">30 days</strong> of receiving this letter. Failure to do so will be considered a violation of my consumer rights, and I will seek legal action if necessary.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #ff007f;">Below is a summary of the information I am challenging:</h3>

    <ul style=" line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        <li><strong style="color: #d50032;">Personal Information:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Name: <span style="color: blueviolet;">{{fullName}}</span></li>
            <li>Address: <span style="color: blueviolet;">{{Address}}</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please remove any name or address from my report that does not match the information listed above, as it is inaccurate and unverifiable.</p>

        <li><strong style="color: #d50032;">Account Information:</strong></li>
        <p>{{disputed_account_details}}</p>
    </ul>

    <p style=" line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Please ensure that these inaccuracies are corrected or deleted, and send me an updated credit report reflecting these changes. As a reminder, it is illegal to process disputes with form letters or to delay them based on third-party assistance. Every dispute must be investigated individually and resolved based on its own merits.
    </p>

    <p style=" line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        Kindly send all correspondence regarding this matter to the following address:
    </p>

    <div style="color: #ff007f; line-height: 0.5">
        <p>{{fullName}}</p>
        <p>{{Address}}</p>
    </div>

    <p style=" line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
        I expect your prompt response in accordance with the FCRA. Failure to comply will result in further legal action to protect my rights.
    </p>

    <p style=" line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
