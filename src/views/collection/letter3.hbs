    <strong>To whom it may concern,</strong>
  </p>

  <p style=" text-align: justify;">
    I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information that appears on my credit report. As a consumer, I have the right to challenge any information that I believe is inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable under the <strong style="color: #ff0066;">Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</strong> and <strong style="color: #ff0066;">Metro 2 standards</strong>. The information in question must be validated and documented before it can be reflected on my credit report.
  </p>

  <p style=" text-align: justify;">
    I strongly contest the validity of any derogatory or delinquent account entries that lack supporting evidence. As such, I refuse to accept these entries as accurate until they are proven to comply with all legal standards. Please ensure that the information on my report is both complete and accurate, as failure to comply with the  <strong style="color: #ff0066;">FCRA and Metro 2 </strong> may result in legal consequences.
  </p>

  <p style=" text-align: justify;">
    For each account that has been marked delinquent or derogatory, I request evidence showing why these claims have been made and how they meet legal reporting requirements. Additionally, I am requesting verification that a permissible purpose was provided for every inquiry that appears on my report. If this cannot be verified, I demand the removal of these inquiries from my credit report.
  </p>

  <p style=" text-align: justify;">
    You have <strong style="color: #ff0066;">30 days</strong> from the date of this letter to investigate and correct these inaccuracies, or remove any erroneous information from my report. Failure to comply will result in me taking further legal action to protect my rights as a consumer.
  </p>

  <p >
    Below is a summary of the information I am disputing:
  </p>

  <ul >
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name: <span style="color: blueviolet;">{{fullName}}</span>, Address: <span style="color: blueviolet;">{{Address}}</span></li> 
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> {{disputedAccountDetails}}</li>
  </ul>

  <p style=" text-align: justify;">
    In accordance with  <strong style="color: #ff0066;">FCRA and Metro 2 standards</strong>, I expect that you will take this matter seriously and provide a written response to my address below. If you continue to send generic form letters in response to this dispute, you will be in violation of my rights under <strong style="color: #ff0066;">15 U.S. Code 1681i</strong>.
